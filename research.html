  <p>My research links the properties of the interstellar medium ISM from large scales measured in extragalactic sources to the small scales observed within the Milky Way. I use novel methods to describe the spatial and spectral properties of the ISM. Linking large and small ISM scales offers insight into many open questions, including: how turbulence is driven, the formation and evolution of molecular clouds, the large-scale distribution of neutral ISM phases, and how environmental properties affect star formation.</p>

  <h2 class="page-heading">Revisiting the Local Group's Atomic Interstellar Medium</h2>

    <p>Local Group galaxies (within 1 Mpc) are ideal target for connecting large and small scale processes. Current radio telescopes can resolve the 20 pc scales of giant molecular clouds, where star formation occurs, while covering the kpc scales of the whole galaxy.</p>

    <p>We have used the VLA to observe M31, M33, and several Local Group dwarf galaxies in the 21-cm HI line, 4 OH lines (1.6-1.7 GHz), and the polarized L-band radio continuum. These sources have been extensively studied at these frequencies, but upgrades to the VLA within the last decade provide (1) improved continuum sensitivity with a larger spectral bandwidth, and (2) improved spectral resolution for the lines. Our HI observations have a spectral resolution of <400 m/s, an improvement by a factor of a few over archival HI observations, which is sufficient to resolve thermal line widths in cool (100 K) atomic gas. Our map of M33, resolving 80 pc scales, is shown below.</p>

    <p>Our first <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.479.2505K/abstract">HI M33 paper</a> with these data shows that HI spectra have a non-Gaussian shape with asymmetric line wings and multiple components. The HI line wings are consistently closer to the systemic velocity than the bright HI component(s), suggesting that this emission traces a rotationally-lagging disc with a larger disc scale height.</p>

    <p>We also investigate different interpretations of HI line width, an key parameter for estimating turbulent energy. We stack HI spectra over large regions of the disc, mimicking analyses used for more distant galaxies with poorer spatial resolution and show that the definition of the centre of the line dramatically changes the line width of the stacked spectrum. When aligning spectra with the peak HI velocity, the smallest line width of 6.7 km/s is recovered consistently across the the inner 10 kpc of M33. This line width is significantly smaller than the 10 km/s used in most extragalactic HI studies.</p>

    <p>We are using the Local Group HI data to create detailed maps of the HI kinematics and how they relate to other tracers or galactic properties.</p>

    <p>The first data release for M33 is available <a href="https://doi.org/10.11570/18.0003">here</a>, which includes HI, OH, and RRL data. Data releases for M31, WLM, Sextans A, IC1613, and additional M33 observations are upcoming.</p>


  <h2 class="page-heading">Linking the Atomic and Molecular Interstellar Medium</h2>


    <!-- <p>Nearby galaxies are the ideal laboratories for this study since current radio telescopes can resolve the tens of pc scales of molecular clouds in both the atomic and molecular ISM. Observations of the atomic gas are the limiting factor here since the VLA can only resolve these scales out to distances of 1 Mpc. The other appealing property of nearby galaxies is that molecular clouds are all at roughly the same distance. In the Milky Way, multiple sources can be detected along a line-of-sight in the disc due to the Sun's position and the distance to each source is often unconstrained. Nearby galaxies provide a uniform sample with this ambiguity.</p> -->

    <p>Molecular clouds form from the atomic ISM and return to it upon their destruction. The relationship between the atomic and molecular ISM, and how they are connected, is imprinted in their local spatial and spectral properties.</p>

    <p>Our <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.485.2324K/abstract">recent work</a> shows that the kinematic properties of the atomic and molecular gas in M33 are closely connected. By stacking HI and CO spectra, we find that the CO line width in M33 is always narrower than the HI, unlike other spiral galaxies whose CO line width is typically the same as the HI. These similar atomic and molecular line widths argue for the presence of a thick molecular disc, containing molecular gas that not related to molecular clouds. The narrower CO line width in M33 suggests it has, at most, a marginal thick molecular disc.</p>

    <p>We also fit the HI and CO spectra with a Gaussian model and show that the HI and CO line widths are strongly correlated, as is shown below.</p>

<center><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}images/sigma_HI_vs_H2_w_fit_cornerplot.png" width="50%"></center>

    <p>The CO is ~0.55 times the HI line width, which is a steeper relation compared to the <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2009ApJ...705..144F/abstract">LMC</a>. There is intrinsic scatter between the line widths that arises from variations between molecular clouds, rather than variations on galactic scales. However, these variations do not seem to be related to molecular cloud evolution. The limitation here is the 80 pc spatial resolution, which is not sufficient to resolve the cloud structure, making it difficult to determine the source of the line width correlation. Revisiting how these properties vary on ~20 pc using additional VLA data across the Local Group will provide further insight into the source.</p>

    <p>Untangling the origins of the line width correlation and the source of the intrinsic scatter would provide key constraints on how the atomic and molecular medium are coupled. In particular, isolating kinematic signatures that vary with cloud evolution would place constraints on the mechanisms on cloud formation and destruction.</p>

<h2 class="page-heading">Observational Diagnostics of Interstellar Turbulence</h2>

    <p>Turbulence is ubiquitous across many phases of the ISM, and its importance in understanding the nature of the ISM has been recognized for decades. Turbulence is studied through its statistical properties and numerous methods have been proposed for extracting these properties from observational data products. Many of these methods are ideal for particular types of data, or may be more robust in the presence of substantial noise. Some methods have lacked a publicly-available and documented implementation, however, limiting the adoption of these methods as standard analysis tools.</p>

    <p>To address this issue, I have developed <a href="https://turbustat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">TurbuStat</a>, a python package with implementations of many turbulence statistics used for ISM observations, with extensive documentation and testing. Our <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019AJ....158....1K/abstract">paper</a> demonstrates the capabilities of the package and common use cases. TurbuStat also extends these methods for use as distance metrics that quantitatively define how different the properties of two data sets are (see next section).</p>

    <h2 class="page-heading">Comparing Observations and Simulations of Star Formation through Experimental Design</h2>

    <p>Molecular clouds observations are difficult to compare due to their highly-structured filamentary substructure. This extended emission makes quantitative comparisons challenging, particularly for assessing how similar numerical simulations are to actual observations.</p>

    <p><a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017MNRAS.471.1506K/abstract">Our work</a> provides a framework for robust comparisons between simulations and observations of molecular clouds. We run a large set of MHD simulations with initial parameters chosen according to experimental design with several "identical" fiducial simulations, differing only in the random seed used for turbulent driving. This simulation set can then be used to: (1) model how statistical properties between simulations are changed with different initial conditions, and (2) estimate the uncertainty in the model by comparing with the "identical" simulations. In this study, we compare properties of simulated observations using <a href="https://turbustat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">TurbuStat</a> and find that many turbulence statistics have intrinsic uncertainties that are often unaccounted for. We also demonstrate the importance of choosing conditions of experimental design: many turbulence statistics are more sensitive to interactions between initial parameters than the parameter itself. By exploring how a statistic varies within a large parameter space, we aim to provide a framework for quantitatively determining how similar observations and simulations are.</p>

    <p>Our further work using these turbulence statistics with sets of simulations shows how <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJ...833..233B/abstract">many methods have unique signatures due to stellar feedback</a> and that <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ApJ...860..157B/abstract">changes in the spectra line and how the radiative transfer is performed also effect turbulence statistics</a>. These studies demonstrate the importance in validating and exploring tools over a large parameter space. </p>


<h2 class="page-heading">Filamentary Properties throughout the Interstellar Medium</h2>

    <p>Filamentary structure is found at nearly all scales in the ISM, from galactic structure to molecular cloud substructure. Filaments provide a unique challenge for algorithmically determining their properties because they are not "blob"-like, as is often used in astronomical source finders, and their connectivity is not easily described.</p>

    <p>I have developed <a href="https://fil-finder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">FilFinder</a>, a morphological-based filament extraction algorithm implemented in python. FilFinder aims to be flexible, with minimal constraints on the structure shape and connectivity. To achieve this, the algorithm searches for locally-bright structure, relative to its immediate neighbourhood, and described the structure using graph theory. This approach makes FilFinder able to characterize filaments over a wide dynamic range in brightness, making it ideal for describing filamentary structure in most astronomical objects.</p>

    <p>The algorithm was originally used to study the filaments in nearby clouds from the <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010A%26A...518L.102A/abstract">Herschel Gould Belt Survey</a>. In <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015MNRAS.452.3435K/abstract">Koch & Rosolowsky (2015)</a> we uniformly analyze the filaments in 11 nearby molecular clouds and find their widths, averaged over whole filaments, are 0.09 pc, similar to other studies, with little cloud-to-cloud variation. We also find that the bright and faint filamentary structure do not have a strong preference in orientation, when compared over the entire cloud.</p>

    <p>My on-going work is using FilFinder to describe the filamentary structure of atomic and molecular gas in nearby galaxies, utilizing new VLA and ALMA observations.</p>

    <p>Also in development is an extension to FilFinder that will work on spectral-line data cubes, allowing kinematic information for filamentary structures to be included.</p>

<h2 class="page-heading">Additional Projects</h2>

    <p>Our M33 HI VLA observations simultaneously recorded the 4 hyroxyl (OH) transitions with frequencies near 1.6 GHz. We detected one source in the <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2018RNAAS...2a..24K/abstract">1665-MHz line</a>. Since the source was not detected in the other OH lines, the line ratios are not what would be expected from thermal equilibrium and so the source is a maser. This is the first OH maser detection in M33. Our additional observations of M33 show hints that there are two sources which were unresolved in our initial observations. We are currently investigating this interesting source with on-going observations.</p>

    <p>I am keenly interested in modeling systematics for commonly measured properties in the ISM. In a recent <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2018RNAAS...2d.220K/abstract">research note</a>, I demonstrated how commonly-used line width approximations systematically over-estimate the true line width in noiseless Gaussian spectra. I then showed how a constant correction factor for finite channels widths over-corrects the bias, leading to under-estimated line widths. The solution, where possible, is to (1) fit an analytic model and forward-model the spectral response function of the spectrometer, or (2) to aim to resolve spectral-lines with 5 channels in the expected FWHM of the line.</p>

    <p>I previously worked on the outburst of a <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2014MNRAS.442..372K/abstract">Very Faint Low-Mass X-ray binary</a> in an undergraduate project.</p>

    <p>I am also involved with a comprehensive study of X-ray emissivity in low density stellar populations, where we model diffuse X-ray emission in terms of other predicted or observable cluster properties. This work has been submitted to MNRAS and is under review.</p>
