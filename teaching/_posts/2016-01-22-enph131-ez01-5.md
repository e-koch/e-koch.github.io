Experiment 6: Acceleration due to Gravity

In today's experiment, you will take a video of a falling ball, upload the video into LoggerPro, and analyze the data to determine the gravitational constant.

LoggerPro can be downloaded via [eClass](eclass).

You can find the slides from today's lab [here](slides).
