<p>I am an astrophysics graduate student at the <a href="https://uofa.ualberta.ca/physics">University of Alberta</a> working with <a href="http://www.ualberta.ca/~erosolow/UAlberta/Home.html">Erik Rosolowsky</a>. I will be finishing my PhD in Summer 2020.</p>

<p>My research connects the properties of the atomic and molecular interstellar medium on scales from whole galaxies to individual molecular clouds.
<!-- I study how atomic and molecular ISM properties are related, and how this relation provides observational constraints on molecular cloud formation, evolution, and destruction. -->
To do this, I spend a lot of time taking observations with radio interferometers.</p>
